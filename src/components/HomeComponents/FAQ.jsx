- Offers privacy and confidentiality (turns out now this is not necessarily true)
- More convenient than other ways of trying to meet people
- Safer than many other conventional dating methods
- The advantage to ‘scientific’ online dating isn’t to come up with some foolproof formula for romantic connection, but it can offer a safeguard to prevent you from making a poor choice.

Disadvantages:
- People lie about themselves
- Users hide information about themselves and one cannot know for certain someone’s true character
- Geographical distance makes physical closeness difficult
- Increased potential for identity theft
- The speed of the online relationship cannot ensure you’re seeing a person for who they really are and all you need to know about someone’s past experiences
- Wasted resources. A third of all online dating users have never met anyone face to face as a result of their time, efforts and money`,

      question: "Online Dating Safety",
      answer: `Online dating websites have become a leading way for people to find their next romance. But users need to understand the risks:

- Keep personal details to a minimum
- Don’t use your real name as your username
- Don’t reveal details about where you live, work, or places you’ll be going
- Message over the app or website instead of giving out your personal phone number
- Do not share images if you don’t feel comfortable
- Remember people are not always who they say they are. Report suspicious users
- Do not feel pressured to meet someone if uncomfortable
- Check a person’s online presence against the details they provide`,
